You have some To-do's Due Soon:

 To-do            Days Left
<% @user.items_due_soon.sort_by(&:duedate).each do |item| %>

<%= item.name %>       <%= item.days_left %>
<% end %>

We hope that you are on track to finish these To-do's on time. But if not feel free to log in and
edit the Due Date's.  <%=link_to "Blocitoff", root_url  %>

Keep Doing,
Bloccit Team
